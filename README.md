CLUBBING

This website was designed for a customers who are looking for a club to go to in Stockholm. The site allows accescibility to the locations and updated general information of each club within one website. It allows an individual to compare locations all in one page rather than openinng several pages just to check what was happening in each club that night. It also consisted of direct communication by mentions from local guides which allows contacting the site in order to make more updates or listen to any requests from several stakeholders. It was therefore significant that we displayed ways to contact and social 

#UX I desgined this project as a one page based site. This would allow for easy navigation due to its simplicity and mobile friendly considering users of the site would most likely be people on the move looking for the next club to go to. As such, it was imperative that I created a site that was mobile-friendly, as a priority. 

Target Audience:

 The website is aimed but not limited to:
	- clubbers
	- club owners
	- tourists
  
  
  #FEATURES:
  
  - Map: The map allows users to be able to make comparisons to do with distances and locations between clubs and identify general information about each one. 
  - Contact form: The form allows users to be able to contact the site owners directly with a message that relates to updates on the clubs and contact that communicates between users and tour guides. For example, asking questions on local guide suggestions. 
  
  - HTML: Provided the content and structure for the website.
  - Bootstrap: The framework was used to create the layout for the page. 
  - CSS: Provides the styling.
  - Coolors: used to create the page colour scheme. 
  
  #TESTING:

Testing was carried out using the developer tools in Google Chrome and also while in preview from Gitpod. I used Google chrom developer mode to check responsovness and the extent to which users could view the page via mobile. Back-and-forth alterations of code occured in order to achieve appropriate responsivness of the forms and the map locations. 

#Page purpose:
 - to present a list of the best clubs to go to in Stockholm
 - to present the locations shown on a map of these clubs
 - to provide updated local guide information
