PAGE

	This website was designed for a customers who are looking for a club to go to in Stockholm. The site allows accescibility to the locations of those clubs around stockholm and other clubs and bars surrounding the stokcholm area. It allows an users to compare locations and basic information of the bars and night clubs all in one page rather than openinng several pages. 

#UX 

	I desgined this project as a one page based site. This would allow for easy navigation due to its simplicity and being mobile friendly considering users of the site would most likely be people on the move looking for the next club to go to quickly. As such, it was imperative that I created a site that was also mobile-friendly and simple, as a priority.
