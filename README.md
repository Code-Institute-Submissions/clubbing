CLUBBING

This website was designed for a customers who are looking for a club to go to in Stockholm. The site allows accescibility to the locations and updated general information of each club within one website. It allows an individual to compare locations all in one page rather than openinng several pages just to check what was happening in each club that night. It also consisted of direct communication by mentions from local guides which allows contacting the site in order to make more updates or listen to any requests from several stakeholders. It was therefore significant that we displayed ways to contact and social 

#UX I desgined this project as a one page based site. This would allow for easy navigation due to its simplicity and mobile friendly considering users of the site would most likely be people on the move looking for the next club to go to. As such, it was imperative that I created a site that was mobile-friendly, as a priority.

I used Google chrom developer mode to check responsovness and the extent to which users could view the page via mobile. Back-and-forth alterations of code occured in order to achieve appropriate responsivness of the forms and the map locations.
